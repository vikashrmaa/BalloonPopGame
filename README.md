Balloon Burst Game Prototype
Description
This is a simple HTML/JavaScript-based game prototype where players can inflate balloons by pressing an air pump, release them to float in random directions, and then burst them by tapping on them. The game is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to play.
